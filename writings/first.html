        <h1>First Writing</h1>
        <p>
            “Just this one night,” I mutter to myself, “please.” I couldn't—I knew I couldn't. Up in the morning, done with my stuff, sleep off, and wake up. A dreadful cycle has come to me.<br><br>
            I gazed at the mirror... again. The reflection didn't leave me; it didn't leave my sight. Can a doctor fix what doesn’t really exist?<br><br>
            Can I fix the feeling, the watch, the staring? If I explained, would it be something watching me? No.<br><br>
            I looked at myself. I would look at it smiling, but it knew... it knew well, the truth, the dread.<br><br>
            All I see is scars; all I feel is burn. My legs don't feel mine anymore—cuts and bruises, so obvious to the world. Obvious enough, but never really... is it ever, though?<br><br>
            I lie down again. The cold wind hits me, but I protect myself. I shiver under my blanket, I sigh, and close my eyes.<br><br>
            Flashbacks and screams… I fall. I yell. I look around. "Where is everybody? Why are they backing away?”<br><br>
            “STOP!” I scream. “Please...” A small yelp—if anything at all. I’m alone again. My eyes open.<br><br>
            I get up, but nothing works. My arms hurt, but I ignore the feeling. I knew what it was anyway.<br><br>
            I run the water down under the sink. “Let it out,” I say. I stare back at the mirror. “You look a bit better,” I say back. The reflection smiled. I was content.<br><br>
            Maybe the marks wouldn’t matter now. I lay down again, and for the first time in weeks, I slept.
