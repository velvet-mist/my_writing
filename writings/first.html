            <p> “Just this one night” I mutter to myself, “please” I couldn't, I knew I couldn't, up in the morning, done with my stuff, sleep off, and wake up. A dreadful cycle has come to me.
                I gazed at the mirror..again. The reflection didn't leave me, it didn't leave my sight. Can a doctor fix what doesn’t really exist?
                Can I fix the feeling, the watch, the staring? If I explained, would it be something watching me? No.
                I looked at myself, I would look at it smiling but it knew... it knew well, the truth, the dread.
                All I see is scars, all I feel is burn. My legs don't feel mine anymore, cuts and bruises, so obvious to the world. Obvious enough but never really, is it ever though?
                I lie down again, the cold wind hits me but I protect myself. I shiver under my blanket, I sigh and close my eyes.
                Flashbacks and Screams… I fall. I yell, I look around. 'Where is everybody, why are they backing away?’
                “STOP!” I scream, “Please” a small yelp, if nothing at all. I’m alone again, my eyes open.
                I get up, but nothing works. My arms hurt, but I ignore the feeling. I knew what it was anyway. 
                I run the water down under the sink. “Let it out,” I say. I stare back at the mirror. “You look a bit better,” I say back. The reflection smiled, I was content. Maybe the marks wouldn’t matter now. I lay down again and for the first time in weeks, I slept.
